For example, an American company like Kiesel will make you a fairly custom guitar, for use in professional musical applications for the $1500-$3500 pricetag; while a foreign import company, like Ibanez, will get you a lower level instrument for the sub-$1000 range, but require a significant $3000+ for a professional grade similar to the previously mentioned family owned USA company that Jeff Kiesel runs."

The basic async calls using Thunks was actually updated quite a bit for try/catch architecture, that throws an error if the fetch reponse is wrong, but also handles any other error in the Promise.reject catch block -- a better approach than was the NuCampsite architecture. I also condensed the initialstate variable for readability. The extra reducer architecture was used, and somewhat modified, for use with a myriad of different JSX components; most pages created using an outside data base for content. The Thunks were, for a couple of examples, tried with .then .catch architecture, but were ultimately reset to the more modern async await approach. While the JSX components and site content are quite different from nucampsite, the overall use of state, with some local exceptions, was very similar to the one used in the NuCamp Redux class."
